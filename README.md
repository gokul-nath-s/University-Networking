# University-Networking
## Project Description  
This project involved designing and implementing a scalable and efficient network infrastructure for **Albion University** using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network was tailored to accommodate a dual-campus setup and meet the connectivity requirements of administrative, academic, and student facilities.

## Key Features  
- **VLAN Configuration**: Segregated traffic to enhance security and manageability.  
- **Routing Protocols**: Implemented RIPv2 for internal routing and static routing for external server connectivity.  
- **DHCP Setup**: Configured a router-based DHCP server to ensure dynamic IP allocation.  
- **Server Integration**: Connected internal servers (web and IT services) and an external cloud-based email server.  
- **Optimized Design**: Focused on scalability, security, and reliability during the design and testing phases.
